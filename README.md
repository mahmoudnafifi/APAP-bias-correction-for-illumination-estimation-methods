How to use:

1- In main.m file, select the dataset from 'dataset' variable, the initial estimation method from 'ill_method' variable, and the correction method  from 'method' variable. 

You can use your own dataset and/or your own initial estimation by using dataset='other'; ill_method ='yourMethodName'; but, remember to add your method name to the switch case in projective_biasCorrection.m file. 
    
    
Also make sure that your file contains a field with your illuminant estimation method. More information is given in main.m file.



2- Run main.m

The main procedure is performed in 'projective_biasCorrection' function which has the followings parameters:

-`data`: a structure that contains the following fields:

1- `gt`: Nx3 ground truth illuminant vectors

2- `illuminant_method_name`: Nx3 initial estimated illuminant vectors. I.e., the variable should be named with the illuminant method name.

   -`ill_method`: a string of the illuminant method name. It should match the
   name of the filed in the `data` struct.

-method: it can be `'P'`, `'APAP'`, or `'APAP-LUT'`

-param: method parameters

#### To add your own method, please update the switch case (line 100) in projective_biasCorrection.m with your method name.
